// mobile: boards below each other
// desktop: boards next to each other
// should have navbar to switch between mobile and desktop view
// state management: Redux
// make sure that there are at least 2 state update actions with
// your state management tool?
// at least 4 React components
// one of those components must receive props from a parent component
// nested components????
// some data should be passed from the child to the parent, should
// not do this with function, but state management tool instead???

// bonus:
// if reset browser mid-game everything lost
// goal: use local storage (window.localStorage to store the state)
// of the game after every action
// clear local storage when game is over

// show ships to the side and allow users to drop them to the board
